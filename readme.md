Adapted by Daniel Matarazzo from an [icon](http://dribbble.com/shots/317512-Sublime-Text-2-Icon) by [Lindsay Mindler](http://lindsayburtner.com/)

Installation (Mac OS X)
------------

With Sublime closed, from this project's folder, run:

    ./mac_replace_icons

You can also just double click on the 'mac_replace_icons' script, and it will run in terminal. Because it uses sudo, you'll need to put in your password.
